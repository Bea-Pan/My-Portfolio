# My-Portfolio :sunflower:
This website was created as my online CV and portfolio. It is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ES6 (the latter added in Node.js environment). While completing this project I used Git Versions Control.


## Responsiveness
The page adapts well to mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

* I used media queries in order to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport
* I used CSS flexbox for proper alignment of the divs and their children elements
* I used CSS grid for proper alignment of the section about me on the main page
* All the links are opened in new tabs
* Contact buttons are active

## Visuals
I used JavaScript DOM to make the page look interesting:

* I created a slide show of my certificates with the control buttons for the viewer to go 'next' and 'prev'
* The information about my skills appears when the users clicks on the respective logo in the skills tab.
* The buttons in the footer change their appearance on mouse hover

I used CSS pseudo selectors to make some hyperlinked buttons change their appearance:
* navigation panel
* projects - GitHub and Web icons
